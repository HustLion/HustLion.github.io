[Snake](https://github.com/HustLion/snake) is my starting point for regular coding. I examined the design of the game from the source code and refactored the code for better reading. Familiarity of javascript improved.

Try it [live]({{ site.url }}/projects/snake/index.htm). (This link works because I cloned my snake project as a submodule of the repo of my site, this is not really convenient. Thanks to [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com/), I can refer to my repo directly now like [this](https://rawgit.com/HustLion/snake/master/index.htm). I tend to use the dev/test version of it.)
